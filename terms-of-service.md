# Cross Reference for Google Docs

## Privacy Policy
Cross Reference makes changes to Google Docs documents and stores user settings in the users Google Docs property stores (document stores and user stores). Cross Reference neither exports nor collects any user data.

The list of figures feature in Cross Reference uses the PDF.js library to process documents as PDFs. However, this library is run within the add-on instance in the document and does not export the PDF to any external servers.
